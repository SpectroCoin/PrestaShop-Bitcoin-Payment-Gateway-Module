## Make it work on localhost

In order to make the plugin work on localhost for testing purposes, <b>change these 3 lines in <em>SCMechantClient.php createOrder() function</em></b>:

`'callbackUrl' => $request->getCallbackUrl(),
'successUrl' => $request->getSuccessUrl(),
'failureUrl' => $request->getFailureUrl()`

<b>To</b>

`'callbackUrl' => 'http://localhost.com',
'successUrl' => 'http://localhost.com',
'failureUrl' => 'http://localhost.com'`

Don't forget to change it back when migrating website to public.
