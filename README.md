## Test order creation on localhost

We gently suggest trying out the plugin in a server environment, as it will not be capable of receiving callbacks from SpectroCoin if it will be hosted on localhost. To successfully create an order on localhost for testing purposes, <b>change these 3 lines in <em>CreateOrderRequest.php</em></b>:

`$this->callbackUrl = isset($data['callbackUrl']) ? Utils::sanitizeUrl($data['callbackUrl']) : null;`, <br>
`$this->successUrl = isset($data['successUrl']) ? Utils::sanitizeUrl($data['successUrl']) : null;`, <br>
`$this->failureUrl = isset($data['failureUrl']) ? Utils::sanitizeUrl($data['failureUrl']) : null;`

<b>To</b>

`$this->callbackUrl = "https://localhost.com/";`, <br>
`$this->successUrl = "https://localhost.com/";`, <br>
`$this->failureUrl = "https://localhost.com/";`

Don't forget to change it back when migrating website to public.

## Testing Callbacks

Order callbacks allow your Prestashop site to automatically process order status changes sent from SpectroCoin. These callbacks notify your server when an orderâ€™s status transitions to PAID, EXPIRED, or FAILED. Understanding and testing this functionality ensures your store handles payments accurately and updates order statuses accordingly. To test callbacks with your integration:
 
1. Go to your SpectroCoin project settings and enable **Test Mode**.
2. Simulate a payment status:
   - **PAID**: Sends a callback to mark the order as **Completed** in WordPress.
   - **EXPIRED**: Sends a callback to mark the order as **Failed** in WordPress.
3. Ensure your `callbackUrl` is publicly accessible (local servers like `localhost` will not work).
4. Check the **Order History** in SpectroCoin for callback details. If a callback fails, use the **Retry** button to resend it.
5. Verify that:
   - The **order status** in WordPress has been updated accordingly.
   - The **callback status** in the SpectroCoin dashboard is `200 OK`.
